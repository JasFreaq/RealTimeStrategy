# RPGProject
This is the source code for a personal project made using Unity. It aims to make a simple Multiplayer Real-Time-Strategy game using [Mirror](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/mirror-129321) for networking.

Feel free to reach out if this project has been of any assistance to you as a reference or otherwise, if you would like to discuss about game development and design with a fellow practitioner, or if you would like to just make a contact in the field.
